# 🪙 Fees

### Network Fees :fuelpump:

Rubicon order books are on-chain, all transactions require network fees (gas) that are paid in ETH. Gas fees on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) are 50-100x cheaper than Ethereum Mainnet, you can monitor them on this [public dashboard](https://public-grafana.optimism.io/d/9hkhMxn7z/public-dashboard?orgId=1\&refresh=5m).

### Trading Fees

**Taker Fee:** **0.01%**

Paid by Swaps, Market Orders, and orders that 'take' liquidity from the order book

**Maker Fee: 0%**

Limit Orders that 'make' liquidity on the order book do not pay fees other than gas

### Liquidity Pool Fees

**Withdrawal Fee: 0.03%**

A withdrawal fee is paid back into the pool, effectively rewarding remaining liquidity providers. Stops pool spam.

(These are variable protocol parameters and could change)
