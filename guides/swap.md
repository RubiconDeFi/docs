# ðŸ’± Swap

[Swap](https://app.rubicon.finance/swap) finds the best route for a token swap on the Rubicon order books:

Select a token to search tradeable assets:

If an order book does not exist for the tokens you're swapping, the router will send the swap through a liquid token like (W)ETH or USDC. To trade directly on the order books, visit [Trade](trade/).
