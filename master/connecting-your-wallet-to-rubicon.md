# üëõ Connecting a wallet

### Connect your wallet to Rubicon ‚õìÔ∏è

Guides for connecting Mobile wallets and Desktop/Browser wallets to the Rubicon App.

(If you need to bridge ETH or other tokens to [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), check out our [Bridge guide](../bridge/bridging-to-optimism.md))

### Mobile/Smartphone wallet

This guide uses the [MetaMask mobile app](https://metamask.io/download.html), which is available on Android and iOS. Before connecting your wallet to Rubicon, you need to add the [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) to your MetaMask:

1.  Open MetaMask and tap on the **Menu icon** in the top left

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png>)


2.  Tap **Settings** in the menu

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (108).png>)


3.  In the Settings menu, select **Networks** to add a custom network

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png>)


4.  Tap on the **Add Network** button at the bottom of the screen

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)


5.  The page will ask you for the details of the New RPC Network. To add the Optimism network, type in these network details:

    **Network Name:** Optimism

    **RPC Url:** [https://mainnet.optimism.io](https://mainnet.optimism.io)

    **Chain ID:** 10

    **Symbol:** ETH

    **Block Explorer URL:** [https://optimistic.etherscan.io](https://optimistic.etherscan.io)


6.  Once you have added the Optimism network, you can exit **Settings** and tap on the **Menu icon**. Then, tap on the **Browser** button

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (109).png>)


7.  Type in "**app.rubicon.finance**" into the search field and hit **go** to start the search. Make sure the URL is **app.rubicon.finance**! (You can bookmark it by tapping on the **3 dots** icon in the bottom left and tapping **Add to Favorites**.)

    ****
8.  &#x20;**** The Rubicon app will ask you to connect your wallet. Tap on the **MetaMask** button

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)


9.  Your wallet will ask you to connect to the Rubicon app. Tap **Connect** to connect your wallet to Rubicon

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)



    You are connected to Rubicon and ready to trade! Remember that you **must** be connected to the Optimism network to connect to the app. You can switch between networks by tapping the **3 dots** icon in the bottom left and selecting **Switch Network**. Scroll to the bottom of the **Networks** page to see the newly added Optimism network.

### Desktop/Web Browser wallet

This guide will use the [MetaMask browser extension](https://metamask.io/download.html) wallet:

Here is the MetaMask home screen, note that the wallet is connected to "Ethereum Mainnet". If you have used Ethereum applications before, this should look normal! This is the main Ethereum blockchain we all know and love.\
\
Let's start by connecting our wallet to Rubicon. When you first launch the Rubicon app, you will see this welcome screen:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (72).png>)

Once we click on the MetaMask button, the Rubicon app will ask for permission to connect to your wallet. Here is the flow to connect your MetaMask to Rubicon:\


![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (79).png>)

![Allow Rubicon to connect to your wallet](<../.gitbook/assets/image (94).png>)

![You are connected and ready to go!](<../.gitbook/assets/image (117).png>)

Great, your wallet is connected to Rubicon! There is only one step left before we can start using Rubicon; we will have to switch networks. \
\
Rubicon is built on layer 2 (L2): Ethereum scaling solutions that take transaction execution off of Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) onto a second layer (L2). These solutions significantly reduce transaction costs and increase transaction throughput while still inheriting Ethereum's security. To learn more about layer 2, check out the Ethereum Foundation's [page](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups/) on the topic.\
\
Rubicon is built on [Optimism](https://optimism.io/). Once you are connected to the Rubicon app, you will be prompted to add the Optimism network to your wallet:

![Approve the new network in MetaMask](<../.gitbook/assets/image (74).png>)

Once you approve the Optimism network, you are connected and ready to use Rubicon! If you need to bridge your tokens to the Optimism network, check out our bridging [guide](https://docs.rubicon.finance/getting-started/using-optimism/bridging-tokens-to-optimism).
