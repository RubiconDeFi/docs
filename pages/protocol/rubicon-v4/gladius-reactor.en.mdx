# Gladius Reactor

The core of Rubicon is the Gladius Reactor. This smart contract houses all of the information used to encode, validate, and execute trades onchain.

The smart contract enables dutch decaying orders, utilizes permit2 for a non-custodial trading experience, and allows limit orders to be partially filled should the order creator opt in.

### Fill Threshold

Gladius Reactor adds a `fillThreshold` parameter to all orders. This parameter represents the **minimum required input amount that a filler must take from an order to fill it**. Its addition provides much efficiency to the ecosystem when matching orders in a high-frequency fashion. As a filler, one should be cognizant of the price ratio for the order to know the minimum required tokens they should pass to the trader to settle a trade.
