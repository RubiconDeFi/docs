# Rubicon Market

## Fees

import { Callout } from "/components/Callout";

<Callout type="fees" title="Protocol Fee: 0.01%">
  Paid by fillers (buyers) to the protocol. Paid in the output token from the
  encoded order - added on top of every order when settled.
</Callout>

<Callout type="fees" title="Possible Pair Specific Fees">
  It is possible for the protocol to set pair specific fees. While this
  unlikely, it can be queried onchain if active
</Callout>

### Querying the Fees

Use these view functions to query the fee values from the RubiconFeeController on any given network.

```solidity copy
    function baseFee()
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current protocol fee. The base fee is the fee applied to all trades, unless there is a pair specific fee set. Return value is an integer at this precision (1 / 100,000 = 0.001%). Default value is 10.

```solidity copy
function fees(bytes pairHash)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current pair-specific fee if any for a given pair hash. Return value is an integer at this precision (1 / 100,000 = 0.001%). Must be set by admin.
