## Market Aid

`MarketAid.sol` is a helper contract that allows the owner to send batches of limit orders and cancel orders on `RubiconMarket.sol` . It makes it easy for active traders and market-makers to place and cancel many outstanding orders in a single transaction! You can think of MarketAid as a middle-layer contract that allows traders to make larger, more efficient, and more complex transactions on the Rubicon order books.

After creating an instance of MarketAid, a trader can use powerful batch functions that extend the low-level 'RubiconMarket.sol' functions `offer` and `cancel` as well as combinations of the two. Send a large batch of limit orders with `batchMarketMakingTrades()` , cancel a batch of open orders and replace them with `batchRequoteOffers()` , or cancel lots of open orders with `scrubStrategistTrades()`. Keep reading for a quick start tutorial and overview of the MarketAid functions.

### Quick Start

Get started with `MarketAid.sol` by creating a personal instance, funding the contract with ERC-20 tokens, and sending your first batch of orders to `RubiconMarket.sol`! You can use `ethers.js` to integrate this into an existing bot, and we are working on tutorials to make it even easier! Let's get started:

1. Create a new instance of the `MarketAid` contract
   1. Deploy a `MarketAid` instance by calling `createMarketAidInstance()` on the `MarketAidFactory` contract. This will spawn a new instance of `MarketAid` that is permissioned to the caller of `createMarketAidInstance()` and automatically approve them as a strategist with access to the contract.
2. Fund your MarketAid instance with the ERC-20s you want to trade (WETH,USDC, DAI, etc.)

   1. Your MarketAid instance can be queried via `getUserMarketAid()` on `MarketAidFactory` or by reading the event emitted from the `createMarketAidInstance()` call.
   2. Verify you control the contract first via Etherscan by checking the `admin` variable is your address and that you are also an `approvedStrategist` .
   3. Verify you are sending funds to the right address!

3. Send batches of Rubicon orders from your MarketAid contract using the functions described below

Note: The owner of a `MarketAid` instance can approve additional addresses to use and access the contract (multiple addresses can clear the `onlyApprovedStrategist` check)

## Troubleshooting

Make sure to check the following:

- Where is my MarketAid instance?
  - Query with `getUserMarketAid()` -> returns an array of all instances you have created
- Your MarketAid instance has approved the contracts you want to interact with
  - Otherwise, transactions will. Using `placeMarketMakingTrades()` will automatically approve the `RubiconMarket` contract
- You are the admin of your Market Aid instance
  - Query with `admin()` on your instance -> returns the EOA that owns the instance
- Any EOA you are trying to manage an ERC20 pair with, via MarketAid is _an approved strategist_
  - Main security check in the contract, admin is auto-approved as a strategist

## Functions (In Progress)

Generally, each of the inputs is the exact same as one would place on the low-level RubiconMarket: the raw uint values of the ERC20s you want to bid and/or ask for when placing offers ( `offer()` ). In order to batch, pass in the values for all the offers as arrays, with all like-variables (e.g. ask numerators) paired together. The arrays passed in must match in legth - this can be helpful when placing a number of offers at once with different prices. Note the use of `formatUnits()` and `parseUnits()` through `ethers` helps with numbers and ERC-20 values when dealing with human number `=` wei conversions.

An important concept is that each order placed through MarketAid (via `placeMarketMakingTrades` ) creates a unique ID that can identify a market maker's outstanding orders. The outstanding book can be queried at any time for any given EOA via `getOutstandingStrategistTrades()` - this is helpful to manage an outstanding book and get the list of unique IDs or `strategistTrades` a given user controls. A market maker can query their book, then requote ( `batchRequoteOffers` ) or cancel ( `scrubStrategistTrades` ) them as needed. Note that fill automatically accrues to the `MarketAid` instance that a user controls.

- placeMarketMakingTrades
  - Place a BID and/or an ASK in a single unique "strategistTrade"
- batchMarketMakingTrades
  - Optionally place many placeMarketMakingTrades calls in a batch fashion to deploy an entire liquidity curve (e.g. 10 bids and 10 asks at differing prices and size depending on market conditions)
- getOutstandingStrategistTrades _view_
  - Returns the unique IDs of a user's outstanding (batch) offers
- getStrategistTotalLiquidity _view_
  - Returns the total ERC-20 book value amount a user controls across the market AND the value sitting on the MarketAid instance
- requote
  - Single requote of a strategistTrade (bid and/or ask pair) to a new pair that generates a new unique id
- batchRequoteOffers
  - Call requote() in batch to update an entire liquidity curve in a single go. This cancels all ids identified and replaces them with the new offer payloads specified
- batchRequoteAllOffers
  - Grabs the user's outstanding book IDs via `getOutstandingStrategistTrades()` then updates them all via `batchRequoteOffers()`
- scrubStrategistTrade
  - Cancels a `strategistTrade` and returns funds that haven't been filled/taken to Market Aid
- scrubStrategistTrades
  - Cancel multiple `strategistTrade`s in a single transaction
- adminPullAllFunds
  - Helpful function for the admin to get all their funds back by specifying the ERC-20s they want
- strategistRebalanceFunds
  - Optional function to use an external liquidity venue to arbitrage against or rebalance funds through
