# Fees

The Rubicon protocol uses a maker-taker fee model, charging trades that "take" liquidity from the order book and paying a rebate to orders that "make" liquidity on the order book. The taker fee is paid in the ERC-20 token that is sent to the contract, and the maker portion is paid directly to the owner address of the filled order(s).

|  Name          | Amount | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Taker          | 0.01%  | Paid by trades that "take" liquidity from the order book      |
| Maker          | 0.008% | Paid by the taker to the owner address of the filled offer(s) |

# Network Fees

Rubicon is an on-chain order book protocol, all transactions need to pay network fees (gas) in ETH. Transactions on L2 networks like [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) are 50-100x cheaper than equivalent ones on Ethereum Mainnet.
