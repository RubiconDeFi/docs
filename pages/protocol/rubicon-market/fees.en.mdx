# Fees

## Network Fees

Rubicon order books are on-chain, all transactions must pay network fees (gas) in ETH. Transactions on L2 networks like [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) are 50-100x cheaper than equivalent ones on Ethereum Mainnet.

## Protocol Fees

Rubicon has a maker-taker fee model, charging a fee to trades that "take" liquidity from the order book and paying a fee (rebate) to orders that "make" liquidity. The taker fee is paid in the ERC-20 token that is sent to the contract, and the maker fee is paid to the owner address of the filled order(s).

import { Callout } from "/components/Callout";

<Callout type="fees" title="Taker Fee: 0.04%">
	Paid by Market Orders, Swaps, and orders that `take` liquidity from the order book
</Callout>

<Callout type="fees" title="Maker Fee: 0.038%">
	Paid by takers to the "maker", the owner address of the filled offer(s)
</Callout>

### Querying the Fees

At a technical level, the **taker fee** is equal to the sum of the **protocol fee** and the **maker fee**.

Returns the current protocol fee.

```solidity
