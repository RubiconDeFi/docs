# Fees

The Rubicon protocol has a maker-taker fee model, charging trades that "take" liquidity from the order book and paying a rebate to orders that "make" liquidity on the order book. The taker fee is paid in the ERC-20 token that is sent to the contract, and the maker fee is paid to the owner address of the filled order(s).

## Fee Schedule

|  Name          | Amount | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Taker          | 0.04%  | Paid by trades that "take" liquidity from the order book      |
| Maker          | 0.038% | Paid by the taker to the "maker", the owner address of the filled offer(s) |

### Querying the Fees

At a technical level, the taker fee is equal to the sum of the protocol fee and the maker fee. 

```solidity
function getFeeBPS()
    public
    view
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current protocol fee.

```solidity
function makerFee() 
    public 
    view 
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current maker fee (rebate).

## Network Fees

Rubicon order books are on-chain, all transactions must pay network fees (gas) in ETH. Transactions on L2 networks like [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) are 50-100x cheaper than equivalent ones on Ethereum Mainnet.
