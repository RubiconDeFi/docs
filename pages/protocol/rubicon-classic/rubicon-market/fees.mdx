# Rubicon Market

## Fees

import { Callout } from "/components/Callout";

<Callout type="fees" title="Protocol Fee: 0.002%">
	Paid by takers (buyers) to the protocol. Paid in the token sent from the taker to the contract.
</Callout>

<Callout type="fees" title="Maker Rebate: 0.001%">
	Paid by the taker to the maker (seller), the address that owns the filled offer during a buy.
</Callout>

The **Total Taker Fee** is equal to the sum of the **Protocol Fee** and the **Maker Rebate**. All market fees (rebates) are paid in the token the buyer is paying to fill an offer.

<Callout type="fees" title="Total Taker Fee: 0.01%">
	Total fee paid by trades that "take" liquidity from the order book (a buy). Paid in the token sent to the contract from the taker.
</Callout>

### Querying the Fees

Use these view functions to query the fee values.

```solidity copy
    function protocolFee() 
        public
        view 
        returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current protocol fee. Return value is an integer at this precision (1 / 100,000 or 0.001%).

```solidity copy
function makerFee() 
    public 
    view 
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current maker fee. Return value is an integer at this precision (1 / 100,000 or 0.001%).

### Calculating Fees for a Trade

Use `getBuyAmountWithFee()` or `getPayAmountWithFee()` to calculate the total amount to send to the contract for a given trade, including fees.

```solidity copy
    function getBuyAmountWithFee(
        IERC20 buy_gem,
        IERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 pay_amt
    ) external view returns (uint256 buy_amt, uint256 approvalAmount) {
        uint modifiedAmount = calculateFees(pay_amt, false);
        buy_amt = (getBuyAmount(buy_gem, pay_gem, modifiedAmount));

        approvalAmount = pay_amt;
        return (buy_amt, approvalAmount);
    }
```

Returns `buy_amt`, the amount of `buy_gem` tokens to send to the contract to receive the `pay_amt` amount of the `pay_gem` token. Also returns `approvalAmount`, the amount of `pay_gem` tokens to approve for the interaction, accounting for fees.

```solidity copy
    function getPayAmountWithFee(
        IERC20 pay_gem,
        IERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 buy_amt
    ) public view returns (uint256 pay_amt, uint256 approvalAmount) {
        pay_amt = (getPayAmount(pay_gem, buy_gem, buy_amt));
        uint modifiedAmount = calculateFees(pay_amt, true);

        approvalAmount = modifiedAmount;
        return (pay_amt, approvalAmount);
    }
```

Returns `pay_amt`, the amount of `pay_gem` tokens to send to the contract to receive the `buy_amt` amount of the `buy_gem` token. Also returns `approvalAmount`, the amount of `buy_gem` tokens to approve for the interaction, accounting for fees.

## Network Fees

Rubicon order books are on-chain, all transactions must pay network fees (gas) in ETH. Transactions on L2 networks like [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) are 50-100x cheaper than equivalent ones on Ethereum Mainnet.
