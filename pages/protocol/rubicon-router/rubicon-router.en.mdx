# Overview

RubiconRouter.sol routes ERC-20 token swaps on the RubiconMarket contract.

[Router Contract Source Code](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/utilities/RubiconRouter.sol)

## Functions

```
function swap(
        uint256 pay_amt,
        uint256 buy_amt_min,
        address[] memory route,
        address to
    ) public returns (uint256)
```

| Parameter Name  | Type    | Description                             |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| pay_amt         | uint256 | Quantity of tokens the taker is selling |
| buy_amt_min     | uint256 | Minimum quantity received of last token address in `route` |
| route           | addresses | First token address is the pay_amt token, last address is the buy_amt token |
| to              | address | Address is the pay_amt token, last address is the buy_amt token |

This function swaps tokens across a specified `route` of token addresses with a minimum received quantity. It enables token swaps across multiple order books on RubiconMarket, in case the tokens do not have an existing order book.
