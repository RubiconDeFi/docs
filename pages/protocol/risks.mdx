# Risk Disclaimer

Only deposit what you can afford to lose, you could lose some or all of your funds. You are encouraged to do your own research and read the code before interacting with the smart contracts.

By interacting with the Rubicon app and/or protocol, you accept and acknowledge our development company's [Terms of Use](https://www.rubicon.finance/terms).

Our goal is for all aspects of the Rubicon protocol to be permissionless. While the protocol is still under active development our core team takes steps to ensure the security of our protocol and test the mechanism in production. One of these steps is keeping the strategist role permissioned; for now, our team acts as the only strategists. Our priority is the long-term health and security of the Rubicon protocol, and we plan to open this role to anyone in the near future.
