### What is Rubicon?

Rubicon is an open platform and protocol for trading [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens, built on  Ethereum. Our ambition is to build the world's last financial exchange on public blockchains. Permissionless, non-custodial, and transparent.

To start trading, visit [**app.rubicon.finance**](https://app.rubicon.finance/).

### What chains/networks are supported?

Rubicon is live on [**Optimism**](https://www.optimism.io/), and will be on more networks in the near future!

### What tokens are supported?

The Rubicon protocol supports trading of any token that adheres to the [ERC-20 standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).

The app uses a default list of popular tokens on each network. Follow this [**guide**]() to add a new token to your local token list. Keep in mind liquidity may be low for new tokens, you might be the first to place limit orders on the book.
