## ðŸ’» Gladius API

The Gladius API is interacted with through this REST endpoint: `https://gladius.rubicon.finance`.

For a preliminary overview of how this is done, check out [our Beta documentation](https://rubicondefi.notion.site/Rubicon-Gladius-Integration-Guide-ee55cbe3ccdf4b88a6780d8ef090599f). More to come here.

For submitting, parsing, and querying orders it is recommended to use the [Gladius SDK](/api-guides/rubicon-v4/gladius-sdk) and `GladiusOrder` order type.
