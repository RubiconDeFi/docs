# Rubicon Gladius

[**Contracts Source Code**](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/gladius-protocol)

## Overview

Rubicon Gladius is an intent-based trading system that relies on the offchain intents pool what provides a gasless market-making and trading experience while remaining non-custodial with onchain settlement.

### `PartialFillLib`

The main library that implements partial execution of an order and contains `GladiusOrder` struct - which, essentially, is an `ExclusiveDutchOrder` with an additional `fillThreshold` parameter, that allows swappers to set a minimum threshold for a partial fill execution.

```solidity
struct GladiusOrder {
    // Generic order information.
    OrderInfo info;
    // The time at which the 'DutchOutputs' start decaying.
    uint256 decayStartTime;
    // The time at which price becomes static.
    uint256 decayEndTime;
    // The address who has exclusive rights to the order until 'decayStartTime'.
    address exclusiveFiller;
    // The amount in bps that a non-exclusive filler needs to improve the outputs by to be able to fill the order.
    uint256 exclusivityOverrideBps;
    // The tokens that the swapper will provide when settling the order.
    DutchInput input;
    // The tokens that must be received to satisfy the order.
    DutchOutput[] outputs;
    // Minimum amount of input token, that can be partially filled by taker.
    uint256 fillThreshold;
}
```

`partition` function is executed during orderâ€™s resolution, it mutates input and output amounts by replacing input amount with `quantity` and calculating output amount, based on the initial exchange rate.

```solidity
    function partition(
        uint256 quantity,
        InputToken memory input,
        OutputToken[] memory output,
        uint256 fillThreshold
    ) internal pure returns (InputToken memory, OutputToken[] memory) {
        ...
        uint256 outPart = quantity.mulDivUp(output[0].amount, input.amount);
        ...
        // Mutate amounts in structs.
        input.amount = quantity;
        output[0].amount = outPart;
```

### `BaseGladiusReactor`

Base reactor logic for settling orders signed off chain, using arbitrary fill methods specified by fillers. `BaseGladiuReactor` implements 8 `execute*` entry-points, capturing an execution flow of these functions and leaving implementation of `resolve` and `transferInputTokens` functions to higher-level reactors.

There are 2 variations of the `execute*` entry point, with the first one representing the basic `execute` and the second one overloading it with the additional `quantity` parameter, which allows `fillers` to execute orders partially (as long as `fillThreshold` allows it as well).

```solidity
/// @dev Only full execution of an 'order'
function execute(SignedOrder calldata order) external;
function executeWithCallback(SignedOrder calldata order, bytes calldata callbackData) external;
function executeBatch(SignedOrder[] calldata orders) external;
function executeBatchWithCallback(SignedOrder[] calldata orders, bytes calldata callbackData) external;

/// @dev Either full or partiall execution of an 'order'
function execute(SignedOrder calldata order, uint256 quantity) external;
function executeWithCallback(SignedOrder calldata order, uint256 quantity, bytes calldata callbackData) external;
function executeBatch(SignedOrder[] calldata orders, uint256[] calldata quantities) external;
function executeBatchWithCallback(SignedOrder[] calldata orders, uint256[] calldata quantities, bytes calldata callbackData) external;
```

### `GladiusReactor`

Inherits `BaseGladiusReactor` and implements `resolve`(x2) and `transferInputTokens` functions. `GladiusReactor` resolves an ABI-encoded `GladiusOrder` into generic `ResolvedOrder` applying `decay` and `partition` functions alongside. Basically, it treats incoming order as an `ExclusiveDutchOrder`, that can be executed not only fully, but also partially.

### `RubiconFeeController`

Applies a fee on each order executed through `GladiusReactor`. `RubiconFeeController` has 2 types of fees - base fee, that is applied on each pair by default, and a pair-based fee, that will be used for a specific pair replacing the base fee, once enabled.
