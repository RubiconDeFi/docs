This page details the current structure and benefits of the Rubicon Liquidity Program. **This program is designed to boost the profitability of liquidity providers and market makers on Rubicon.** The program is designed to incentivize liquidity providers through monthly fee rebates. For any questions or further information, please reach out to us via [contact@rubicon.finance](mailto:contact@rubicon.finance) or our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/E7pS24J).

In its current structure, if a given trader achieves a volume greater than the Volume Minimum for any Tier, they will be rebated the Percentage of Fees Refunded from the Rubicon Team to their trading wallet following the conclusion of the monthly period. Rebates would be paid in ERC20 fees generated and on the network where the monthly volume was earned. The Rubicon Team reserves arbitrary discretion to exclude addresses from the program. This could be due to perceived wash trading or self trading as this behavior is strictly prohibited.

**Only volume through the Rubicon App or API and settled/filled by the Rubicon Engine are counted towards the program. Market Makers and Traders must participate through the open order book. Generally all trading pairs count towards the program - trading pairs that are not supported on the Rubicon App are not likely to count towards the program. Generally, any trading pairs for liquid, reputable coins will count but that is up to the Team's discretion.**

### Liquidity Program Tiers
