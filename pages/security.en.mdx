# Security Overview

<Callout type="warning">
While we implement extensive security measures, DeFi interactions carry substantial risks. Please review our [Risk Disclaimer](/risks) before using the protocol.
</Callout>

## Best Practices üîê

We strongly recommend following security best practices when interacting with Rubicon:
- Use a hardware wallet or multi-signature wallet for significant positions
- Always clear-sign your transactions and verify the contract addresses
- Follow proper wallet security hygiene

## Protocol Security Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Rubicon's security is built around our three-layer liquidity stack. Each component undergoes rigorous testing and auditing.

### Rubicon Gladius ‚öîÔ∏è

Our next-generation intent-based trading system. Built as a derivative fork of Uniswap X with extended functionality for partial fill limit orders.

#### Audits
Please review our current security audits on the [Audits Page](/developers/protocol/audits).

#### Expected Interactions
Gladius uses a signature-based intent trading system:

1. **Initial Setup**
   - One-time approval of the [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2) contract (a widely-used, shared contract across DeFi)
   - No other contract approvals needed
   - Note: Native ETH is not supported as an input - users must wrap to WETH first (hence "Wrap and Swap" or "Wrap and Trade" UI prompts)

2. **Trading Flow**
   - Each trade is a gasless signature (intent to trade)
   - Signatures include time duration and slippage parameters
   - Orders typically execute via dutch auction pricing or limit orders
   - Your order is either filled within your specified terms or nothing happens

3. **Execution Process**
   - Signatures are broadcast to the filler network
   - First executor to include your order in a block executes the trade
   - Executors can be market makers, bots, or other traders
   - Partial fills are possible for limit orders optionally

<Callout type="warning">
When operating trading bots on Rubicon, exercise extreme caution with bot hot key security for order signing.

### Rubicon Classic üìö

Our fully on-chain order book system for peer-to-peer trading, live on Optimism since 2021 with continuous auditing and iteration in production.

#### Audits
Please review our current security audits on the [Audits Page](/developers/protocol/audits).

#### Expected Interactions
When using Classic, you should expect:
1. Initial token approvals: Approve the Market or Router contract to spend your tokens (not needed for native ETH inputs)
2. Transaction execution: Direct wallet transaction for order placement/execution

#### Addresses
See our [Classic Deployments](/developers/deployments#rubicon-classic-deployments) page.

### Aquila AMM üåä

Aquila is our automated market maker system, **a direct fork of Uniswap V2.** We've made minimal, namesake-only changes to this battle-tested AMM codebase.

#### Audits
While Aquila itself is currently unaudited, it is a direct fork of the extensively audited Uniswap V2 protocol. All contracts are verified on-chain and open source.

#### Expected Interactions
When using Aquila, you should expect:
1. Initial token approvals: You'll need to approve the Router or Pair contracts to spend your tokens (not needed for native ETH inputs)
2. Transaction execution: After approval, a direct wallet transaction for the swap/add/remove liquidity

#### Addresses
All contracts are verified and open source. See our [Aquila Deployments](/developers/deployments#rubicon-aquila-deployments) page.

## Bug Bounty Program üêõ

We actively encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and possibly compensate security researchers for their efforts.

<Callout>
While we are in the process of establishing a public third-party bug bounty program, please report any security concerns to [contact@rubicon.finance](mailto:contact@rubicon.finance). Valid reports are eligible for bounties, which can be paid out directly or through the [Rubicon Forum](https://forum.rubicon.finance/) DAO process.
