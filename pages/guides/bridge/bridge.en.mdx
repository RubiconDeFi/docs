The {<a href={siteUrls.baseUrl + "bridge"}>Bridge</a>} on Rubicon uses the powerful [Socket API](https://www.socket.tech/) to find the best bridge route for you to send tokens between blockchains. Visit our [bridge guide](/docs/guides/bridge/bridging-to-optimism) to learn how to bridge tokens to Optimism.

You can view which route gets you the most tokens on the destination chain and also compare the fees for each bridge:
