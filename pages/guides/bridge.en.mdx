## Rubicon Bridge

The [Rubicon Bridge](https://app.rubicon.finance/bridge) finds you the best route to send tokens between blockchains. It supports major token bridges, hundreds of ERC-20 tokens, and popular EVM chains.

The Rubicon Bridge is powered by [Socket](https://socket.tech/). For support or troubleshooting with a bridging transaction, visit the Socket [Knowledge Base](https://socketdottech.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

## Native Bridges

You can always use a network's native bridge to send ETH or tokens from Ethereum Mainnet. Keep in mind that on the native bridge of optimistic L2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, deposits are processed instantly but withdrawals have a one-week delay.
