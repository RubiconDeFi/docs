## Rubicon Points Leaderboard v0

import { Callout } from "/components/Callout";

<Callout type="fees" title="Work In Progress and Subject to Change">
  NOTICE: *All points are based on historical onchain actions.* Points effects are subject to arbitrary change and *points can change retroactively*. New data will be added in as well as data may be potentially removed. *All that counts towards points are onchain actions* - subject to change at any time. Current points standings are found in the Leaderboard feature of our app. Addresses can be arbitrarily removed as well.
</Callout>

This page details the current onchain actions that earn users points. This table can arbitrarily change at any time - see your current points total in the Leaderboard feature of the app. The goal of this page is to detail what qualifies for points, how this might change in the future, and our historical changes to the contest in the ChangeLog.

## Likely Future Additions (v0)
Potential and expected future additions of actions:
- Expansion of the v0 Points system to all supported networks with varying multipliers. We plan to launch on MATIC ASAP; already live on ETH, ARB, and BASE.
- Historical Rubicon v1 and v2 Trades (Rubicon Classic) BEFORE the launch of Gladius (1/1/2024)
- Historical deposits from Pools v1 from BEFORE the deprecation and wind down of the product (Summer 2023 - Pools are withdraw only and it is recommended to withdraw; no new deposits would qualify)

## Changelog (v0)
- v0 is published in the above table. All that is included in v0 of the Rubicon Points Leaderboard are lifetime Rubicon trades (traders and fillers) in the Gladius system. The only network supported so far is data from Optimism.
