# Protocol Incentives

The Rubicon protocol employs a dynamic incentive structure that combines upfront liquidity provider (LP) rewards with retroactive performance-based distributions. This page outlines the current incentive structure, which will be updated over time based on protocol performance and DAO decisions.

## Monthly Distribution Overview

**Target Monthly Distribution:** 36,458,333.3333 RUBI (0.364583% of total supply)  
**Target Annual Distribution:** 437,500,000.0000 RUBI (4.375000% of total supply)

## Initial Rewards Structure

### Active LP Rewards (25% of Monthly Emissions)
These rewards are funded upfront and available for immediate farming:

| Pool | Type | Allocation |
|------|------|------------|
| RUBI/USDC | LP Upfront Rewards | 7.500% |
| RUBI/WETH | LP Upfront Rewards | 17.500% |

### Retroactive Performance Rewards (75% of Monthly Emissions)
These rewards are distributed retroactively based on the [leaderboard](https://app.rubicon.finance/leaderboard) data:

| Activity | Source | Allocation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Gladius Volume (Any Dollarized) | EOM Data/Leaderboard | 23.000% |
| Volume - Select AQ Pairs | EOM Data/Leaderboard | 35.000% |
| Awareness Awards | EOM DAO Decision | 1.000% |
| Partnerships/B2B Deals | EOM DAO Decision | 8.000% |
| User Acquisition | EOM DAO Decision | 8.000% |

## How It Works

### Immediate LP Rewards
- Active now on Base network
- Stake your LP tokens from RUBI/USDC or RUBI/WETH pools
- Rewards are distributed continuously
- Claim rewards through the [app interface](https://app.rubicon.finance/)

### Retroactive Volume Rewards
- Represent the majority of incentives (58% combined)
- Based on actual trading activity and volume
- Tracked via the public [leaderboard](https://app.rubicon.finance/leaderboard)
- Distributed at the end of each month
- Rewards scale with contribution to protocol volume

### Strategic Incentives
- 17% allocated for ecosystem growth
- Includes awareness, partnerships, and user acquisition
- Distributed through DAO governance decisions
- Focuses on sustainable protocol growth

## Dynamic Adjustments

The incentive structure is designed to be flexible and responsive:
- Monthly review of effectiveness
- DAO can adjust allocations based on performance
- Focus on maximizing protocol growth and sustainability
- Rewards follow value creation
