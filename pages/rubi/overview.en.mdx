# RUBI Overview

Rubicon exists to build the **World's Last Financial Exchange** — a decentralized, non-custodial trading platform that democratizes access to global markets. Our mission is to accelerate the advent of an open, efficient, and transparent financial system for humanity, governed and operated by its users.

## Protocol Architecture

Rubicon's trading platform consists of three core layers, known as the "legendary triple stack":

### 1. Gladius – Aggregator Layer
- RFQ auctions across the open internet
- Non-custodial, permit2 signature-based execution
- Gasless swap execution
- Best price routing between Rubicon liquidity and external sources

### 2. Classic – Onchain Order Book
- Public, performant onchain order book
- Live since 2021
- Fully onchain ERC20 limit orders

### 3. Aquila – Automated Market Maker
- Uniswap V2 fork for passive liquidity
- Enables simple LP provision
- Enhanced composability

## Protocol Achievements
- Over **$200 million** in onchain trading volume
- **4 years** of continuous operation
- Every trade non-custodial and verifiable
- Active across multiple chains including Base, Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum

## Governance
The protocol is governed by the $RUBI token, a utility governance token forked from Aave V2. This enables:
- Decentralized protocol control
- Community-driven decision making
- Onchain voting mechanisms
- Long-term alignment between protocol and users

## Core Principles

The Rubicon DAO operates on four founding principles:

1. **Long-Termism**: Building on an infinite time horizon with sustainable growth
2. **Frugality**: Maintaining lean and efficient operations
3. **Fundamentals**: Focus on building real value through liquidity and assets
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Commitment to constant enhancement and development
