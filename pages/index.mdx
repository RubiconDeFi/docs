## What is Rubicon?

[Rubicon](https://rubicon.finance/) is an order book protocol for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/). Use it to trade [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens with Swaps, Limit Orders, and Market Orders or provide liquidity in Pools.

Rubicon is built on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum [L2](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/#:~:text=Layer%202%20(L2)%20is%20a,the%20security%20guarantees%20of%20Ethereum.) chain.

## Protocol Overview

RubiconMarket.sol is a [limit order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_order_book) smart contract. It implements a matching engine and order books for peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens.

Rubicon Pools is a system of smart contracts that enables passive liquidity providers (LPs) to deposit tokens in a pool, where active market makers (strategists) use the pool assets on the order books. Yield from market-making goes to LPs, and strategists earn a performance fee.

## Developers: Start the Rubicon Protocol Locally

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubicon_protocol.git   
$ cd rubicon_protocol && npm i
$ npm i --save-dev openzeppelin-solidity@2.5.1
$ truffle init
$ 'n' for overwriting contracts
$ 'n' for overwriting migrations
$ (in separate terminal) ganache-cli
```

Also make sure that you comment out the lines in truffle-config.js that say `development:` and include localhost under networks so that you can connect to Ganache.&#x20;

```bash
$ truffle migrate -- deploys contracts to development network, i.e. localhost
$ truffle test -- run the set of tests provided in the test folder of repo
```
