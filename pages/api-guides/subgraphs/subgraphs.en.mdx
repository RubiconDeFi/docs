## ðŸ’» Subgraphs

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, allowing easy access to data that can be difficult to query directly. Rubicon subgraphs are currently on The Graph's hosted service and will soon be migrated to the Decentralized Network.

### **Key Subgraphs**

The Rubicon protocol has two main subgraphs, one that contains legacy data from `v1` on Optimism and one for all other `v2` deployments:

* [RubiconV2](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-subgraphs/tree/master/RubiconV2): Tracks trading activity (maker/taker trades) on the Rubicon order books.
* [RubiconV2_Optimism](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-subgraphs/tree/master/RubiconV2_Optimism): Expands on the `RubiconV2` subgraph to include legacy `v1` events on Optimism.
