## ðŸ’» Subgraphs

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, allowing easy access to data that can be difficult to query directly. Rubicon subgraphs are currently on The Graph's hosted service and will soon be migrated to the Decentralized Network.

### **Key Subgraphs**

The Rubicon protocol has two main subgraphs, one that contains legacy data from `v1` on Optimism and one for all other `v2` deployments:

* [RubiconV2](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-subgraphs/tree/master/RubiconV2): Tracks trading activity (maker/taker trades) on the Rubicon order books, used to query market data and activity.
* [RubiconV2_Optimism](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-subgraphs/tree/master/RubiconV2_Optimism): Tracks trading activity (maker/taker trades) on the Rubicon order books, used to query market data and activity. Includes activity on Optimism from `v1` of the protocol.

### **Deployments**

Our team maintains these subgraphs for each protocol deployment. You can find active deployments below:
