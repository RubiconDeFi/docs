# Rubicon APIs

Rubicon has several APIs for retrieving data regarding the protocol. While you can always interact directly with the [Rubicon smart contracts](/protocol/deployments) to get data regarding current chain state, the APIs provide a convenient way to query both current and historical data from the protocol, solving the problems typically associated with blockchain data retrieval. The APIs are powered by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), and you can learn more about them in our [Subgraphs](/api-guides/subgraphs/subgraphs) section.

## Hosted API

Rubicon provides a hosted API for retrieving data regarding the protocol. This API is free of charge to all user's, and aims to provide the most up-to-date information regarding the protocol. In addition to Rubicon's hosted API, users can also access data through [The Graph's Hosted Service](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service), which serves as a backup to Rubicon's own hosted hardware. Soon, Rubicon will migrate its API to the [decentralized network](https://thegraph.com/explorer), where users can expect even greater reliability and performance.


### Deployments

    Each network has its own API endpoint. Be sure to use the correct endpoint for the network you are querying.

## Python SDK

A Python library for interacting with Rubicon. Contains a growing list of utility functions for retrieving and formatting data from the Rubicon API. The SDK is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-py).
