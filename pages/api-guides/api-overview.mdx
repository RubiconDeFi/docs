# Rubicon APIs

Rubicon provides various APIs for accessing protocol data. Rather than manually engaging with [Rubicon smart contracts](/protocol/deployments) for chain state info, these APIs allow for easy querying of current and past data, bypassing standard blockchain data retrieval hurdles. Powered by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), additional details on these APIs can be found in our [Subgraphs](/api-guides/subgraphs/subgraphs) section.

## Hosted API

Rubicon offers a free hosted API for protocol data. This API, supplemented by The Graph's Hosted Service as a backup, aims to deliver the latest protocol information. In the near future, Rubicon will transition its API to the decentralized network for enhanced reliability and performance.

### Deployments

    Each network has its own API endpoint. Be sure to use the correct endpoint for the network you are querying.

## Python SDK

A Python library for interacting with Rubicon. Contains a growing list of utility functions for retrieving and formatting data from the Rubicon API. The SDK is open source and available on [Github](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubi-py).
