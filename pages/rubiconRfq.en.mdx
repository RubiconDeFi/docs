</Callout>

The Rubicon RFQ System exists to make our market maker's liquidity more accessible for price discovery. This system is designed to facilitate aggregators and traders seeking the best price by providing real-time quotes and streamlined execution. The RFQ System will evolve over time, adapting to the needs of the market and feedback from users.

### 1. Authentication
To obtain an API key for authentication, clients need to create a nickname, which will be used in the `tag` field. Then, contact Rubicon to obtain an API key. The API key will be assigned to the `tag` to authenticate requests.

With a valid API key, all RFQ queries should be sent to the base URL of `https://hydrus-serverus-e805ae31d1b4.herokuapp.com` while targetting the relevant endpoint, as described below. **Please note, that in the authentication process we also approve a specific address that is permitted to transact with `RubiconRFQ`; please coordinate with the team to arrange this.**

### 2. Querying Price Levels
To query price levels, use the following endpoint:

```
GET https://hydrus-serverus-e805ae31d1b4.herokuapp.com/price-levels
  ?chainId=<int>
  &tag=<string> # "nickname" of a client
  &sellToken=<string>
  &buyToken=<string>
  &deadline=<string> # unix timestamp - a deadline of a quote, used to return orders that will be valid until it 
  --header "X-API-KEY: obtained_key"
```

The response will have the following structure:


```json
{
  "status": "success|fail",
  "chainId": "100",
  "pair": {
    "base": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "quote": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  },
  "levels": [
    {
      "qMin": "100.10",
      "q": "1000.10",
      "p": "250.50"
    }
  ]
}
```
### 3. Sending a Quote for a Match
To match a quote with the off-chain book, use the following endpoint:


```
GET https://hydrus-serverus-e805ae31d1b4.herokuapp.com/match
  ?chainId=<int>
  &tag=<string> # "nickname" of a client
  &sellToken=<string>
  &buyToken=<string>
  &sellAmt=<string>
  &buyAmt=<string>
  &deadline=<string> # unix timestamp - a deadline of a quote, used to return orders that will be valid until it
  --header "X-API-KEY: obtained_key"
```

### 4. Getting Match Response
The server response will have the following structure:


```json
{
  "orders": [{
    "encodedOrder": "0x...",
    "signature": "0x..."
  }],
  "quantities": ["0", "...", "n"]
}
```

### 5. Executing Response Data On-Chain
**To execute the response data on-chain, first, approve sell tokens to the `RubiconRFQ` contract. This is a very important step and approvals must be in place or else the trade will fail.**

Then, call the fill function on the contract for the relevant network you are targetting. Please see below for the deployments on each chain.

The fill function signature:

```solidity
function fill(Quote calldata q, Response calldata r) external {}
```

Where Quote is:

```solidity
struct Quote {
    address sellToken;
    address buyToken;
    uint256 sellAmt;
    uint256 buyAmt;
}
```
And Response is:

```solidity
struct Response {
    SignedOrder[] orders;
    uint256[] quantities;
}
```

### RFQ Contract Addresses
Below are the RFQ contract addresses per network:

| Network | Contract Address |
| ---- | -------------- |
| OP    | 0xf8C8308a7C89315B8395A945C32E879a1295cD20          | 
| Base    | 0x6b6B6aA808423FBeCc9cCeb4fDefFb76a550bAe7          |
