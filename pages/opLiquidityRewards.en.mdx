### Program Split Tiers

OP rewards are calculated on a **weekly epoch basis** and distributed periodically on Optimism based on the following criteria.

| Tier | Criteria |
| ---- | -------------- | 
| 10%  | OP/USDC Maker Score (Based on DyDx Formula) (Classic weighted 50% more than Gladius) |
| 50%  | Taker Volume (Gladius) |
| 40%  | OP/USDC LP Staking |

### Maker Rewards by Order Book Maker Score

[Please see here for a breakdown of how this math works](/liquidityProviderMath).

Maker rewards account for **10%** of the total program distribution. This is based on the liquidity provider reward formula. Resting orders that qualify and meet the configured criteria will be rewarded. Note that a bid and ask that are resting and meet the criteria are required - **please see the formula breakdown above.**

- **Classic and Gladius Systems Qualify**:
  - Orders placed through the Classic system receive a **50% bonus** in reward points.
  - Orders placed through the Gladius system are credited at their normal rate.

Taker rewards are based on total volume of trades executed by takers on the platform through the Gladius system.

### Liquidity Rewards System

Using our liquidity rewards formula, market makers that provide liquidity through resting limit orders near the spread are credited. They must maintain a bid and an ask to be credited. Our system polls randomly once every minute to sample the order book and reward makers maintaining a bid and an ask according to the same formula DyDx popularized. Note that the system rewards the orders closer to the spread much more creating a competitive environment.

| Valid Market Pairs | Minimum Order Size (Depth) | Maximum Spread |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------- |
| OP/USDC  | $100  | 0.005 |

Classic and Gladius systems are eligible for liquidity rewards, with Classic orders receiving a 50% bonus.

### Taker Rewards

Taker rewards are distributed as follows, based on liquid USD trading volume through the Gladius system:
- **50%** allocated to taker rewards across any valid trading pair.

### LP Staking Rewards

LP Staking Rewards will be distributed by staking in the LP feature in the app. This staking contract will be funded for multiple weeks and have a dynamic APR calculation baked in based on USD TVL of the LP and pending rewards. Users can deposit or withdraw at any time. The staking contract used is a fork of the one created by and popularized by Synthetix.
