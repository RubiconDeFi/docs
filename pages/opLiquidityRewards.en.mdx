### Program Split Tiers

| Tier | Criteria |
| ---- | -------------- | 
| 80%  | Trading (Maker) Volume          |
| 20%  | Liquidity Rewards System         |

OP rewards are distributed weekly on Optimism and distributed based on two criteria.

### Trading (Maker) Volume

Any trades through the API where an order is created and someone fills and settles your trade onchain will count as valid volume. In practice, this is all normal trades, with the credit going to the person that traded through the platform (maker/user) not the filler of the trade.

### Liquidity Rewards System

Using the liquidity rewards formula popularized by DyDx, market makers that provide liquidity through resting limit orders near the spread are credited. They must maintain a bid and an ask to be credited. Our system polls randomly once every minute to sample the order book and reward makers maintaining a bid and an ask according to the same formula DyDx uses.

[Please see here for a breakdown of how this math works](https://docs.dydx.community/governance-documentation/rewards/liquidity-provider-rewards). Please see the following tables for the valid trading pairs on Optimism and relevant parameters.

| Valid Market Pairs | Minimum Order Size (Depth) | Minimum Spread |
