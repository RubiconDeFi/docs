## Critical Warning

The Rubicon protocol is experimental software operating in the high-risk domain of decentralized finance (DeFi). *Interacting with the protocol exposes you to risks that could result in the complete loss of your funds.* Before interacting with Rubicon, you must understand and accept these risks.

## Key Risks

- **Smart Contract Risk**: Despite thorough auditing and testing, smart contracts may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
- **Market Risk**: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Sudden price movements can affect your positions and potentially lead to losses or trade execution at a loss.
- **Liquidity Risk**: Providing liquidity (LP/Aquila/AMM) has risks related to loss, underperformance relative to holding, impermenant loss, and toxic arbitrage flow.

## DeFi Security Context

The DeFi ecosystem has experienced numerous security incidents, with [total losses exceeding billions of dollars](https://rekt.news/leaderboard). Major protocol exploits have ranged from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. Users must approach DeFi interactions with extreme caution and thorough due diligence.

## Important Guidelines

1. **Never invest more than you can afford to lose**
2. **Do your own research** - Read and understand the smart contracts before interacting
3. **Start small** - Test interactions with small amounts first
4. **Monitor your positions** - DeFi requires active management
5. **Be wary of scams** - Verify all contract addresses and websites

## Terms of Use

By interacting with Rubicon sites and applications, you accept and acknowledge the [Terms of Use](https://www.rubicon.finance/terms). You confirm that you understand the risks involved and that you are acting on your own behalf with full knowledge of the potential consequences.
