# Democratized Designated Market Making (DDMM)

Democratized Designated Market Making (DDMM) is a framework for incentive programs on Rubicon where asset issuers can directly reward active liquidity providers (market makers) on a specific trading pair. During a DDMM program, addresses are evaluated based on their maker volume, depth, and other KPIs. At the end of the program, the rewards are airdropped to addresses that actively provided liquidity on the relevant pair(s).
