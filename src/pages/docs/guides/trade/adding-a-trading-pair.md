# Adding a Trading Pair

The Rubicon protocol is permissionless: the order book contract supports trading of any [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens!&#x20;



You can add a trading pair with a new token locally to the [**Rubicon App**](https://app.rubicon.finance/trade) in just a few steps:

1. Select the **Token Menu** at the top of the **Trade** page:
   ![Token Menu](</assets/image(15).png>)

2. Choose the **Quote Token** you want for the new Trading Pair:
   ![Quote Token](</assets/image(106).png>)

3. Click **Add Token** and paste the contract address of the new token. Make sure to add the correct address for the token on Optimism, verify this on the [Optimism block explorer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tokens):

4. Once you paste the token address and add it, you will see the new trading pair on your menu:

5. Select the new pair to view the new order book and start placing limit orders:

Building liquidity for a new order book can be difficult. On a new pair, you may need to be the first one to add liquidity by placing limit orders on the book

Rubicon market makers monitor new pairs and can add support for a pair if it gains traction. The team is working on a more permanent solution that allows anyone to create a new liquidity pool, trading pair, and initialize an order book in a single transaction.
