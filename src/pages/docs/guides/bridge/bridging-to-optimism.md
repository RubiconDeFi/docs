# Bridging to Optimism

To start trading or providing liquidity on Rubicon, you need ETH on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/).

Use the Bridge in the [Rubicon App](https://app.rubicon.finance/) to find the best bridging route!

## Bridge Guide

This guide shows you how to bridge tokens to Optimism from another chain. Our example converts USDC on Polygon to ETH on Optimism:

1. Connect to the Rubicon App and select **Bridge** from the sidebar:\

4. After selecting the number of tokens you want to transfer, you will be prompted to switch to the "Transfer from" chain in your wallet (if you did not already):\

5. The Bridge finds the best route that gets you the most tokens on the destination chain. You can also choose a route with a lower fee. In this example, the Hyphen bridge gets us the most ETH on Optimism and has low fees:\
