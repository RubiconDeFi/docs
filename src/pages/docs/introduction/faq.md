## What is Rubicon?

Rubicon is an order book protocol that enables peer-to-peer trading of [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens. It is built on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum layer 2 (L2) chain.

Token Swaps, Market/Limit Orders, Liquidity Pools, and a Bridge are available on the [Rubicon App](https://app.rubicon.finance/)&#x20;

### What wallets are supported?

The Rubicon App supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) wallets like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/).

If you are new to Ethereum and need a wallet, use [this tool](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/) to find the right one for you!

### What chains/networks is Rubicon on?

Rubicon is built on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 chain.

Rollups (both [optimistic](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/) & [zero-knowledge](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/)) are Ethereum's future execution layers, and the Rubicon protocol will be deployed on the leading ones.

### How do I move tokens to Optimism?

The Bridge in our App finds the best bridging route to Optimism and other chains. Keep in mind that to pay [network fees (gas)](trade/fees.md), you will need ETH on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) for all transactions.

You can purchase ETH (or another token) directly into a wallet on Optimism by using **Buy Crypto** on the App sidebar. This fiat on-ramp from [Ramp](https://ramp.network/) supports credit/debit cards, ApplePay, and some bank transfers.

### What are the fees?

### How do the Liquidity Pools work?

The Rubicon order book protocol has liquidity pools. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit crypto assets into a pool and receive bathTokens, which represent their proportional share of the underlying pool assets. \
(Ex. LP deposits ETH, receives bathETH)

Liquidity pools are used by active market makers (strategists) to provide liquidity on the order books. Yield from market-making goes to LPs (bathToken holders) and strategists earn a performance fee.

View bathTokens holdings (Pools LP positions) under [Portfolio](https://app.rubicon.finance/portfolio) on the app.

### What tokens are available for trading?

The Rubicon protocol is permissionless: the order books support trading of any ERC-20 token!

Follow this [guide](trade/adding-a-trading-pair.md) to add a new token/trading pair **locally** on the App, keep in mind liquidity can be low on new trading pairs.

### Where can I get support?

For support join our [Discord ](https://discord.com/invite/E7pS24J)and ask questions in the **#support** channel. Our team will never message you first or ask for your seed phrase!

### Does Rubicon have a whitepaper?

Yes, the Rubicon v1 [whitepaper](https://github.com/RubiconDeFi/rubicon-protocol-v1/blob/master/Rubicon%20v1%20Whitepaper.pdf) is on GitHub. It outlines the specs of the protocol and our vision for the order books.
