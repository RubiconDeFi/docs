# ðŸ“Š RubiconMarket

The RubiconMarket smart contract implements on-chain order books and a matching engine for peer-to-peer trading of ERC-20 tokens.

An order book is simply a list of buy and sell orders for an asset, organized by price. This contract implements each ERC20/ERC20 order book as two double-linked sorted lists, one for the Buy-side and one for the Sell-side of the given market.

The contract uses an escrow model for liquidity; when a limit order is placed on the book, those tokens are sent to the contract. If/when the order is filled, the contract matches the traders directly, and the . An order can be canceled and the contract will return the tokens to the sender.

RubiconMarket is a derivative work of MakerDAO's [OasisDEX](https://oasisdex.com/) and inherits the open-source AGPL-3.0 license.


## Trading Functions

#### offer()

```
    function offer(uint pay_amt, ERC20 pay_gem, uint buy_amt, ERC20 buy_gem, uint pos) 
        public returns (uint)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pay\_amt               | uint256     | Quantity of ERC-20 tokens the maker is selling                                                                                    |
| pay\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the maker is selling                                                                                                 |
| uint buy\_amt          | uint256     | Quantity of ERC-20 tokens the maker is buying                                                                                     |
| ERC20 buy\_gem         | address     | ERC-20 token the maker is buying                                                                                                  |
| uint pos               | uint256     | Position in the sorted list to place the order. Set this to 0 unless you know the exact position (closest ID) to insert the order |
| \[Optional] matching   | bool        | Optional boolean that dictates whether or not the offer should be automatically matched if possible                               |

This is the primary function for placing limit orders on RubiconMarket. The 'pay_amt' quantity of the 'pay_gem' token will be sent to the order book contract, sitting in escrow until it's filled or canceled. Always set pos to 0 unless you know the exact position to insert your order.

#### cancel()

```
    function cancel(uint id)
        public
        can_cancel(id)
        returns (bool success)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id                     | uint256     | The id of the order the user wants to cancel   |

This function cancels an offer on the order book and returns the tokens to the sender's address. The **can\_cancel** modifier checks that the target order is active and is owned by the caller. Alternatively, you can also use the **kill()** routing function to achieve the same result and cancel an offer.

#### buy()

```
    function buy(uint id, uint amount) public can_buy(id) 
        returns (bool)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id                     | uint256     | The id of the target order                     |
| amount                 | uint256     | Quantity of the target order to buy            |

This function is used to fill or "cherry pick" a specific order in the book. The caller will pay the taker fee. Alternatively, you can also use the **take()** routing function to achieve the same result and fill a specific offer.

## Routing Functions

These functions are for "Fill-Or-Kill" orders; they will fill completely or the transaction will revert.

#### buyAllAmount()

```
     function buyAllAmount(
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 buy_amt,
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 max_fill_amount
    ) external returns (uint256 fill_amt)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| buy\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is buying               |
| buy\_amt               | uint256     | Quantity of tokens the taker is buying         |
| pay\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is selling              |
| max\_fill\_amount      | uint256     | Maximum amount of pay tokens received          |

Attempts to trade buy\_amt quantity of buy\_gem tokens for at most the max\_fill\_amount quantity of pay\_gem tokens. Transaction will revert if the trader would spend more than the specified maximum amount.

Ex. Trader attempts to buy...

#### sellAllAmount()

```
     function sellAllAmount(
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 pay_amt,
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 min_fill_amount
    ) external returns (uint256 fill_amt)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| pay\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is selling              |
| pay\_amt               | uint256     | Quantity of tokens the taker is selling        |
| buy\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is buying               |
| min\_fill\_amount      | uint256     | Minimum amount of buy tokens received          |

Attempts to trade sell\_amt quantity of sell\_gem tokens for at least the min\_fill\_amount quantity of pay\_gem tokens. Transaction will revert if the trader would receive less than the specified minimum amount.

Ex. Trader attempts to sell...

## View Functions

#### getBestOffer()

```
function getBestOffer(ERC20 pay_gem, ERC20 buy_gem)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the ID of the offer at the top of the order book.

Ex. Calling this function with WETH as pay_gem and USDC as buy_gem will return the best ask on WETH/USDC. Switching the tokens will return the best bid.

#### getWorseOffer

```
function getWorseOffer(uint256 id) 
    public 
    view 
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the next worse offer in the sorted list. The worse offer is the higher one if the target order is an ask, and a lower one if it's a bid. In both cases, it will return a newer one if they are equal.

#### getOfferCount()

```
function getOfferCount(ERC20 sell_gem, ERC20 buy_gem)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
```

Returns the number of offers in the order book for a specified pair.

#### getFeeBPS()

```
function getFeeBPS() 
    public 
    view 
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the protocol taker fee, in basis points.
