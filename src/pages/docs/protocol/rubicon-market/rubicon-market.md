# ðŸ“Š Rubicon Market

## Overview

The Rubicon Market smart contract implements on-chain order books and a matching engine for peer-to-peer trading of [ERC-20 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).

An order book is a list of buy and sell orders for an asset, sorted by price. This contract implements each ERC20/ERC20 order book as two double-linked sorted lists, one for the Buy-side and one for the Sell-side of the given market.

The contract uses an escrow model for liquidity; when a limit order is placed on the book, those tokens are sent to the contract. If/when an order is filled, the contract matches the traders directly and the tokens are sent to each party. An order can be canceled and the contract will return the tokens to the sender.

Rubicon Market is a derivative work of MakerDAO's open-source [OasisDEX](https://oasisdex.com/) and inherits the AGPL-3.0 license.


## Trading Functions

### offer()

```
    function offer(
        uint256 pay_amt,
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 buy_amt,
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 pos,
    ) public returns (uint256)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pay\_amt               | uint256     | Quantity of ERC-20 tokens the maker is selling                                                                                    |
| pay\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the maker is selling                                                                                                 |
| uint buy\_amt          | uint256     | Quantity of ERC-20 tokens the maker is buying                                                                                     |
| ERC20 buy\_gem         | address     | ERC-20 token the maker is buying                                                                                                  |
| uint pos               | uint256     | Position in the sorted list to place the order. Set this to 0 unless you know the exact position (closest ID) to insert the order |
| \[Optional] matching   | bool        | Optional boolean to determine whether the offer should be automatically matched (placed in the sorted list)                       |

The primary function for placing limit orders on Rubicon. The **pay_amt** quantity of the **pay_gem** token will be sent to the order book contract, sitting in escrow until it is filled or canceled. Always set pos to **0** unless you know the exact position in the sorted lost to insert the order.

### cancel()

```
    function cancel(uint id)
        public
        can_cancel(id)
        returns (bool success)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id                     | uint256     | The id of the order the user wants to cancel   |

This function cancels an offer on the order book and returns the tokens to the sender's address. The **can\_cancel** modifier checks that the target order is active and is owned by the caller. Alternatively, you can use the **kill()** routing function to achieve the same result and cancel an offer.

### buy()

```
    function buy(uint id, uint amount) public can_buy(id) 
        returns (bool)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| id                     | uint256     | The id of the target order                     |
| amount                 | uint256     | Quantity of the target order to buy            |

This function is used to fill or "cherry pick" a specific order in the book. The caller will pay the taker fee. Alternatively, you can use the **take()** routing function to achieve the same result and fill a specific offer.

### buyAllAmount()

```
     function buyAllAmount(
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 buy_amt,
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 max_fill_amount
    ) external returns (uint256 fill_amt)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| buy\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is buying               |
| buy\_amt               | uint256     | Quantity of tokens the taker is buying         |
| pay\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is selling              |
| max\_fill\_amount      | uint256     | Maximum amount of pay tokens sold              |

Attempts to trade **buy\_amt** quantity of **buy\_gem** tokens for at most the **max\_fill\_amount** quantity of **pay\_gem** tokens. Transaction will revert if the trader would spend more than the specified maximum amount. This is a "Fill-or-Kill" buy order.

### sellAllAmount()

```
     function sellAllAmount(
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 pay_amt,
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 min_fill_amount
    ) external returns (uint256 fill_amt)
```

| Parameter Name         | Type        | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| pay\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is selling              |
| pay\_amt               | uint256     | Quantity of tokens the taker is selling        |
| buy\_gem               | address     | ERC-20 token the taker is buying               |
| min\_fill\_amount      | uint256     | Minimum amount of buy tokens received          |

Attempts to trade **sell\_amt** quantity of **sell\_gem** tokens for at least the **min\_fill\_amount** quantity of **pay\_gem** tokens. Transaction will revert if the trader would receive less than the specified minimum amount. This is a "Fill-or-Kill" sell order.

## View Functions

### getBestOffer()

```
function getBestOffer(ERC20 pay_gem, ERC20 buy_gem)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the ID of the offer at the top of the order book.

Ex. Calling this function with WETH as **pay_gem** and USDC as **buy_gem** will return the best ask on WETH/USDC. Switching the tokens will return the best bid.

### getWorseOffer()

```
function getWorseOffer(uint256 id) 
    public 
    view 
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the next worse offer in the sorted list. The worse offer is the higher one if the target order is an ask, and a lower one if it's a bid. In both cases, it will return a newer one if they are equal.

### getBuyAmount()

```
    function getBuyAmount(
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        uint256 pay_amt
    ) external view returns (uint256 fill_amt)
```

Returns the amount of **buy\_gem** tokens received if a specified amount of **pay\_gem** tokens are spent. Used to check the current state of the order book.

### getPayAmount()

```
function getPayAmount(
        ERC20 pay_gem,
        ERC20 buy_gem,
        uint256 buy_amt
    ) external view returns (uint256 fill_amt)
```

Returns the amount of **pay\_gem** tokens needed to buy a specified amount of **buy\_gem** tokens. Used to check the current status of the order book.

### getOfferCount()

```
function getOfferCount(ERC20 sell_gem, ERC20 buy_gem)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
```

Returns the number of offers in the order book for a specified pair.

### getFeeBPS()

```
function getFeeBPS() 
    public 
    view 
    returns (uint256)
```

Returns the protocol taker fee, in basis points.
