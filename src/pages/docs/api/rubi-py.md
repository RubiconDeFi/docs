**rubi-py** is a repository for all things related Python ü§ù Rubicon. The ultimate goal of **rubi-py** is to provide useful tooling for interacting with the Rubicon Protocol and to be a place of collaboration for Python developers on Rubicon. Today, **rubi-py** mainly acts as a home for **rubi**, a Python SDK built on **web3.py** for interacting with the Rubicon Protocol. Want to contribute?
