## What is Rubicon?

Rubicon is an order book protocol for Ethereum. You can use it to trade [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) tokens with limit orders, market orders, swaps, and batch orders!

You can swap, trade, and provide liquidity using the [Rubicon App](https://app.rubicon.finance/).

### What chains/networks is it on?

Rubicon is built on Ethereum L2 networks that have low fees and near-instant confirmations. Currently, Rubicon is live on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). The protocol will be deployed on more Ethereum L2 networks in the future!

### How do I move tokens to Optimism?

Use the [Bridge]([url](https://app.rubicon.finance/bridge)) in the App to find the best bridging route to Optimism from other blockchains. Keep in mind that to pay network fees (gas), you will need ETH on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) for all transactions.

You can purchase ETH (or another token) directly into a wallet on Optimism by using **Buy Crypto** on the sidebar. This fiat on-ramp from [Ramp](https://ramp.network/) supports credit/debit cards, ApplePay, and some bank transfers.

### What tokens are available for trading?

The Rubicon protocol is permissionless: the order book contract enables trading of any ERC-20 token!

Follow this [guide](trade/adding-a-trading-pair.md) to add a new token/trading pair **locally** on the App, keep in mind liquidity can be low on new trading pairs.

### What wallets are supported?

The Rubicon App supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/) wallets like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/).

If you are new to Ethereum and need a wallet, use [this tool](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/) to find the right one for you!

### What are the fees?

[Fees](/guides/trades/fees)

### How do the Liquidity Pools work?

The Rubicon order book protocol has liquidity pools. Liquidity providers (LPs) deposit crypto assets into a pool and receive bathTokens, which represent their proportional share of the underlying pool assets. 
(Ex. LP deposits ETH, receives bathETH)

Liquidity pools are used by active market makers (strategists) to provide liquidity on the order books. Yield from market-making goes to LPs (bathToken holders) and strategists earn a performance fee.

View bathTokens holdings (Pools LP positions) on [Portfolio](https://app.rubicon.finance/portfolio) in the App.
