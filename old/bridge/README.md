# ðŸŒ‰ Bridge

The [Bridge](https://app.rubicon.finance/bridge) on Rubicon uses the powerful [Socket API](https://www.socket.tech/) to find the best bridge route for you to send tokens between blockchains. Visit our [bridge guide](bridging-to-optimism.md) to learn how to bridge tokens to Optimism.

You can view which route gets you the most tokens on the destination chain and also compare the fees for each bridge:

It also supports cross-chain swaps! For example, you can easily swap USDC on Polygon for ETH on Optimism:

The Bridge currently supports major token bridges, hundreds of ERC-20 tokens, and popular EVM blockchains/L2s:\
